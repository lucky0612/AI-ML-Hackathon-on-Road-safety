# Intelligent Road Safety System

The Intelligent Road Safety System is a comprehensive solution aimed at preventing accidents and enhancing road safety through the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This system encompasses various features, including real-time accident detection, driver behavior analysis, road condition monitoring, intelligent traffic management, collision prevention systems, and crash data analysis.

## Features

1. **Real-time Accident Detection:**
   - Detect accidents in real-time using CCTV cameras or drones.
   - Analyze video feeds using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for anomaly detection.
   - Provides real-time alerts for potential accidents.

2. **Driver Behavior Analysis:**
   - Analyze driver behavior patterns using Decision Trees or Random Forests.
   - Predict the likelihood of risky behavior leading to accidents.
   - Utilizes GPS and accelerometer data for analysis.

3. **Road Condition Monitoring:**
   - Predict accident likelihood based on weather, traffic, and road surface conditions.
   - Utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Deep Neural Networks for prediction.
   - Integrates data from weather sensors, traffic cameras, and road surface sensors.

4. **Intelligent Traffic Management:**
   - Optimizes traffic flow using Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
   - Identifies traffic patterns through clustering algorithms like K-means.
   - Suggests alternative routes and provides traffic flow optimization recommendations.

5. **Collision Prevention Systems:**
   - Identifies potential hazards using YOLO or Faster R-CNN architectures.
   - Takes corrective measures through reinforcement learning or rule-based systems.
   - Alerts drivers and initiates automatic corrective actions to prevent collisions.

6. **Crash Data Analysis:**
   - Classifies crash types using SVM or Random Forests.
   - Extracts insights from textual data using NLP techniques.
   - Provides actionable insights for improving road safety measures.
